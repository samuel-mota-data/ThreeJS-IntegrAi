# ThreeJS-IntegrAi

This repository demonstrates how to integrate a Three.js-based 3D interactive web application with ThingsBoard, leveraging AI-generated code (via ChatGPT) to streamline development. The project provides a starting point for building visually engaging industrial IoT dashboards, blending real-time telemetry data with advanced 3D graphics.

## Features

- **Three.js Integration:** Renders 3D objects, scenes, and animations directly in the browser.
- **ThingsBoard Data:** Connects with ThingsBoard to retrieve real-time telemetry and dynamically update the 3D environment.
- **AI-Generated Code:** Utilizes code suggestions and refinements from ChatGPT, making the initial setup and future expansions more efficient.
- **Open Source & Customizable:** Based on open-source technologies, allowing full customization and adaptation for commercial use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js & npm:** Ensure you have the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- **ThingsBoard Account:** Access to a ThingsBoard instance with devices sending telemetry data.
- **A Web Server (Optional):** For local development, you may use a simple HTTP server like `http-server` from npm.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samuel-mota-data/ThreeJS-IntegrAi.git
